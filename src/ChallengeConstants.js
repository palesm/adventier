    wikiInfo: `Fisherman’s Bastion in Budapest is one of the top Budapest 
    attractions without a doubt. The present day lovely lookout towers / 
    decorative fortification of Fisherman’s Bastion were built in the 19th 
    century to serve as a lookout tower for the best panoramic views in 
    Budapest, Hungary. Needless to say, there used to be real castle walls
     where now you can take fantastic photos from, but the present day 
     structure has never served as an actual fortification in Buda.`,

    wikiInfo: `St. Stephen's Basilica (Hungarian: Szent István-bazilika 
      [sɛnt ˈiʃtvaːn ˈbɒzilikɒ]) is a Roman Catholic basilica in Budapest,
       Hungary. It is named in honour of Stephen, the first King of
        Hungary (c 975–1038), whose right hand is housed in the reliquary.
         It was the sixth largest church building in Hungary before 1920.
          Since the renaming of the primatial see, it has been the 
          co-cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of 
          Esztergom-Budapest. Today, it is the third largest church 
          building in present-day Hungary.`,
