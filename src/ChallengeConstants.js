    attractions without a doubt. The present day lovely lookout towers / 
    decorative fortification of Fisherman’s Bastion were built in the 19th 
    century to serve as a lookout tower for the best panoramic views in 
    Budapest, Hungary. Needless to say, there used to be real castle walls
     where now you can take fantastic photos from, but the present day 
     structure has never served as an actual fortification in Buda.`,
